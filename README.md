# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Pyber Analyis
The purpose of the project is to analyze the data of PyBer, a python based ride sharing app. An exploratiry analysis was performed on the large data using Jupyter notebook, pandas and Matplotlib to create visual charts that illustrate the results. Once the data was seperated by the different types of cities, drivers and total fares. A line graph was created to display the results from 5 months. 

## Results

The results determined that the Urban area was making the most profit and Rural was making the least amount. The rural had 125 total rides, suburban had 625, and lastly, urban had 1625. The average fare per ride seemed to demonstrate the rural has having the least average far and urban had the most.

## Challenge Overview

Overall a line graph was shown to display the results using Matplotlib. Some recommendations I have for improving include urban public transportation and expanding it towards suburban areas. Creating incentives to encourage more drivers to utilize the transportation service. Lastly, because total drivers and riders are inversely proportional, we should work towards decreasing the number of drivers, which would increase the use of transportation services.
